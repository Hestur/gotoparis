While presumably adding vast amounts of hidden cabling and replanting the garden courtyard, the modern hotel has preserved its period furniture and paintings à la Louis XV, and kept some of the cult features like the divisive gold swan taps. The 142 rooms and suites are crammed with patterned carpets, Empire-style lamps, chandeliers, canopied beds, rococo desks, embossed velvet sofas, and period oil paintings. The hotel has the world's first Chanel spa, bringing a gentle waft of perfume, to accompany the gym and the galleried indoor pool, kept at a tropical 31°C. </h2>

                        and plazas, from the foot of the Arc de Triomphe, where they take the start, towards the Place
                        de la Concorde. From the Rue de Rivoli they'll then sweep through the Place de la Bastille.

                        largest museum. No need to stand in line! This guided tour offers the perfect opportunity to
                        learn about the museum's huge collection and its greatest works of art, such as the Mona Lisa,
                        the Venus de Milo, and the Coronation of Napoleon.

                        Before it became a museum in 1793, the Louvre had long been one of the principle palaces of the
                        Kings of France. Located right in the heart of Paris, the Louvre's galleries stretch for
                        786,000 square feet. It is home to the world's largest collection of art works, spanning more
                        than 7,000 years from ancient civilizations to the 19th Century. The museum's collections are
                        split into eight different departments: Egyptian antiquities, Greek, Etruscan & Roman
                        antiquities, Near Eastern antiquities, Islamic art, Paintings, Sculptures, Decorative Arts, and
                        Prints & Drawings.

                    <p>
                        Inspired by the English music hall style in 1919, it was originally named “Palace Theatre” in
                        hopes to appeal to British soldiers during WWI. A few years later, it was renamed Théâtre
                        Mogador after an old city in western Morocco and inaugurated by the then-future American
                        president, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The theatre has been a venue dedicated to musical shows,
                        gaining its fame with performances such as Sergei Diaghilev’s “Ballet Russes”, and operettas
                        such as Mistinguett, one of France's most popular singers throughout the 1920s and 1930s. With
                        its French charm, British playhouse architectural inspiration, and famous international shows,
                        the Théâtre Mogador has been pleasing audiences for over a century.



                        Théâtre Mogador is right in the middle of the 9th arrondissement, where you can find also many
                        bustling restaurants and bars, or explore the beautiful Parisian Passage des Panoramas.



                        The Théâtre Mogador is the place to see Broadway-esque renditions, and in the past has welcomed
                        celebrated productions such as Cats, The Lion King, or Mamma Mia! The Théâtre Mogador is now a
                        space that frequently welcomes classic Broadway shows with a French twist, perfect for a
                        Parisian theatre night.
