              The Eiffel Tower is the most famous sight in Paris, built by
              Gustave Eiffel in 1889 with 6,300 tons of iron — that means 18,000
              pieces of iron and 2.5 million rivets. With a height of 300
              meters, for a long time it was the highest tower in the world.
              Over 6 million people visit it every year. There are three levels
              that you can visit, and the highest one is 2nd above the ground.
              It was made for a fair, but the French government wanted to tear
              it down. With rising popularity, it stayed.

              The Louvre is a museum with very famous, old works of art, such as
              the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The building was built as a
              house for French kings. The Louvre is the third biggest museum in
              the world, with 60,000 square meters of show room.[5] It is the
              most visited art museum in the world with over 5 million people
              visit it each year.

              The Musée d'Orsay was a train station, but it is now an art
              museum. Most of the art at the Musée D'Orsay was made between 1848
              and 1915. This is newer than the art at the Louvre.

              The capital city of France needs no introduction given its
              reputation for being the world's most romantic city. The Eiffel
              Tower has appeared in too many movies and shows to count, while
              the Louvre Museum was even the main attraction in the popular
              movie series, The Da Vinci Code, and is also home to one of the
              world's most famous artworks - the Mona Lisa. Landmarks aside, the
              city is home to locals known for being fashion forward. Many big
              names such as Chanel, Hermes, and Louis Vuitton have their roots
              in the city and continue to shape the global fashion scene.

              right in the heart of Paris, the Louvre's galleries stretch for
              786,000 square feet. It is home to the world's largest collection

              civilizations to the 19th Century. The museum's collections are

            <p>
              Inspired by the English music hall style in 1919, it was
              originally named “Palace Theatre” in hopes to appeal to British
              soldiers during WWI. A few years later, it was renamed Théâtre
              Mogador after an old city in western Morocco and inaugurated by
              the then-future American president, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The
              theatre has been a venue dedicated to musical shows, gaining its
              fame with performances such as Sergei Diaghilev’s “Ballet Russes”,
              and operettas such as Mistinguett, one of France's most popular
              singers throughout the 1920s and 1930s. With its French charm,
              British playhouse architectural inspiration, and famous
              international shows, the Théâtre Mogador has been pleasing
              audiences for over a century. Théâtre Mogador is right in the
              middle of the 9th arrondissement, where you can find also many
              bustling restaurants and bars, or explore the beautiful Parisian
              Passage des Panoramas. The Théâtre Mogador is the place to see
              Broadway-esque renditions, and in the past has welcomed celebrated
              productions such as Cats, The Lion King, or Mamma Mia! The Théâtre
              Mogador is now a space that frequently welcomes classic Broadway
              shows with a French twist, perfect for a Parisian theatre night.
